# Cryptix: Compile-Time String Encryption & Obfuscation Framework for Rust

Cryptix is a Rust-based compile-time string encryption framework designed to protect sensitive literals from static analysis tools. It provides a powerful set of macro-based tools that obfuscate string constants during compilation, decrypting them only at runtime in memory-safe and optionally customizable ways.

âœ¨ Inspired by [litcrypt](https://github.com/anvie/litcrypt.rs)
- This project is heavily inspired by `litcrypt`, a compile-time literal encryption crate.

ðŸ”§ Why Cryptix?
Unlike other crates like litcrypt, Cryptix offers:
- More encryption options.
- Fully customizable encoding behavior.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Compile-Time Encryption: Encrypts string literals at compile time using a variety of algorithms.

- Macro-Based Usage: Simple two-letter macro interface for embedding encrypted strings in your code (e.g., `cx!("my string", "<method>")`).

- Multiple Encryption Modules:
	- `aes`: AES-256-CBC with PKCS7 padding, no block-modes crate.
	- `xor`: Lightweight XOR-based obfuscation.
	- `base64`: Custom base64 encoding with a shuffled alphabet.

- Static Key/IV: Secret keys and IVs are embedded directly in the library, no need for environment variables.

- Cross-Platform: Works on both Linux and Windows.

## ðŸ“¦ Example Usage

```yaml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
cryptix_1988 = "0.6.0"
cryptix_macros = "0.3.0"
```

```rust
//main.rs

use cryptix_macros::cx; // new
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    let secret_xor = cx!("private-token", "xor");
    println!("Decrypted XOR: {}", secret_xor);

    let secret_aes = cx!("private-token", "aes");
    println!("Decrypted AES: {}", secret_aes);

    let secret_b64 = cx!("private-token", "b64");
    println!("Decode Base64: {}", secret_b64);

    Command::new(cx!("powershell.exe", "xor")) // "xor" method
        .arg(cx!("-NoProfile", "aes")) // "aes" method
        .arg(cx!("-Command", "b64")) // "b64" method
        .arg(cx!("[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String('YwBhAGwAYwA=')))", "aes")) // "aes" method
        .status()
        .expect("failed to execute process");
}
```

This will:

- Encrypt "private-token" at compile time using the xor encryption module.
- Store it encrypted in your binary (not visible via static tools: `strings`, `hexdump`, etc).
- Decrypt it at runtime just-in-time for use.

Cryptix will encrypt each string written inside cx! statically.

Check the output binary using strings command to verify:

```bash
strings target/debug/my_app | grep private-token
```

If the output is blank then your valuable string in your app is safe from static analyzer tool

For working example code see `./examples` directory, and test using:

```bash
cargo run
```
